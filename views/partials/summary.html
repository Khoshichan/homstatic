<p>During the last 5 years I have developed a wide range of large web projects based on <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Drupal</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong>.
  The scale of the projects meant I also had to became familiar with <strong>Varnish</strong> and various technologies that helps to scale web applications.</p>
<p>For me itâ€™s very important to keep my code <em>clean</em>, <em>readable</em>, <em>well structured</em> and always <em>under source control</em>.</p>
<p>I also follow best practices and adhere to principles such as a <strong>TDD/BDD</strong>, <strong>DRY</strong>, <strong>KISS</strong>.</p>
