## PhpStorm: Create structure of module
It's very helpful to create module structure by one click.

Create bash script for it:

    #!/bin/sh
    mkdir "$1"
    echo "<?php" > "$1/$1.module"
    echo "" >> "$1/$1.module"
    echo "name = $1" > "$1/$1.info"
    echo "core = 7.x" >> "$1/$1.info"
    echo "version = '7.x-1.0'" >> "$1/$1.info"

Save this code to file, for example `~/bin/drupal_create_module.sh`
And give permissions to run: `chmod +x ~/bin/drupal_create_module.sh`

Go to _Preferences->External Tools_ and add new tool.
