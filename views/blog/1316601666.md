## Change variables for current session only
If you want change variables (ex. _'example_var'_) for current session only, then you can change `$GLOBALS['conf']['example_var']`

Then you try to call `variable_get('example_var', '')`, new value will be returned, however variable table in database will not be changed. It is very useful for small hacks.
